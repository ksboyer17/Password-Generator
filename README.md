# Password Generator

This project was generated by Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

For this project I refactored and made functional a password generator. The pass word generator will generate a password between 8 and 128 characters long. Along with length, users will have the option to choose if they would like their passwords to include uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, and also special characters. This project provided me with the opportunity to practice my Javascript skills and practice applying console.logs and other semantical elements involved in Javascript.
