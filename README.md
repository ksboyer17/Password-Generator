# Password Generator

This project was generated by Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

For this project I refactored and made functional a password generator. The pass word generator will generate a password between 8 and 128 characters long. Along with length, users will have the option to choose if they would like their passwords to include uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, and also special characters. This project provided me with the opportunity to practice my Javascript skills and practice applying console.logs and other semantical elements involved in Javascript.

**Functionality/Instructions For Use**
1. Input how long you would like your password to be.
2. Select what characters/ characteristics you would like your password to include.
3. Press "Generate Password".
4. A password will be generated matching the criteria that the user selected.
5. In the event that the user inputs a number not between 8 and 128, a password will not be generated and the user will be alerted to chose an acceptable length.
6. If the user does not select any character boxes, the user will also be alerted to do so.
